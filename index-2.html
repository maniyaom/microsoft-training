        <p>World-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered a simpler system for
            transforming your life. He knows that lasting change comes from the compound effect of
            hundreds of small decisions - doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or
            holding a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits.</p>
